# docs +write

> **PREREQUISITE:** Read `../gws-shared/SKILL.md` for auth, global flags, and security rules. If it is missing, install `skill/gws-shared` or use the `pack/google-workspace` bundle.

Append text to a document

## Usage

```bash
gws docs +write --document <ID> --text <TEXT>
```

## Flags

| Flag | Required | Default | Description |
|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--document` | ✓ | — | Document ID |
| `--text` | ✓ | — | Text to append (plain text) |

## Examples

```bash
gws docs +write --document DOC_ID --text 'Hello, world!'
```

## Tips

- Text is inserted at the end of the document body.
- For rich formatting, use the raw batchUpdate API instead.

> [!CAUTION]
> This is a **write** command — confirm with the user before executing.
